#Simple Jekyll Site

This is a set of front-end-tools set up to help make a quick (and hopefully painless) Jekyll Blog/Site. 
It uses technologies such as [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), 
and of course [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Included are a set of already set up files to use for your new jekyll site. The npm `package.json` that has all 
of the information for any node packages and grunt packages. Also included is a `gruntfile.js` which has all of 
the grunt tasks that are needed for everything to run smoothly. Feel free to use and/o modify this in any way 
you please.
